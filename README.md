# Hello, I'm Justin Ferwerda!

I am a software developer passionate about all things data. I love making full-stack projects and especially love backend and business logic. I am currently a part-time instructor at Nashville Software School teaching Python/Django.

### About Me

I have been a full-time musician for many years, but have always enjoyed problem-solving and data-related endeavors. I am excited about a new career and continuing to learn new skills!
